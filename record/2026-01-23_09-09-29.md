# Project Status Record (2026-01-23 09:09:29)

This record captures the current state of the Vaca project based on the repository contents.

## Current Status

The README states that Vaca is an alpha-stage language with no backwards compatibility guarantees.

## What Is Done

- EDN-based reader/parser (VEDN) with spans, annotations, collections, keywords, numbers, and
  error reporting (`src/vedn/*`).
- Tree-walker interpreter core (bezerro) with evaluation of lists, vectors, maps, sets, and
  symbols (`src/bezerro/eval/*`).
- Special forms implemented: `def`, `defn`, `fn`, `if`, `do`, `let`, `quote`, `defmacro`, `use`,
  `|>`, `recur`, `loop` (`src/bezerro/eval/special_forms.rs`).
- Tail-call support via `recur` and `loop`.
- REPL and script runner with multi-line handling and stack overflow guard (`src/main.rs`).
- Module system via `(use ...)` with file resolution, name mangling, caching, and cyclic import
  detection (`src/bezerro/eval/use_form.rs`).
- Built-in runtime functions for arithmetic, comparison, logic, basic I/O, parsing, and vector
  operations (`src/bezerro/builtins.rs`).
- Documentation across `docs/vaca-lang` plus `REFERENCE.md` and `README.md`.

## What Is Not Yet Implemented (Inferred)

- `deftype` is currently a stub that returns `nil`.
- No type-checking or semantic phase despite documented types and `#` annotations.
- Standard library modules described in docs (fs, http, json, net, etc.) are not present as runtime
  implementations.
- Macro system is minimal; no evidence of quasiquote/unquote or hygienic expansion tools.
- Evaluator errors do not integrate parser spans for richer diagnostics.

## Likely Next Steps (Inferred)

1. Implement the type system and hook it to `#` annotations.
2. Implement user-defined types and make `deftype` meaningful.
3. Expand the standard library to match documented modules.
4. Add macro tooling (quasiquote/unquote) and richer macro expansion support.
5. Add semantic validation and better error reporting using source spans.
